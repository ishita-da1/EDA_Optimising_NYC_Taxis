**Objective:**
This assignment aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in real-world scenarios. In addition tousing the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will develop a basic understandingof analytics for real-world situations, how to integrate them into a narrative and draw usable insights.
**Business Value:**
In this case study, you will learn about exploratory data analytics with the help of a data set on yellowtaxi rides in New York City. Taxis play a crucial role in New York City’s urban transport network.With the city’s dynamic environment, taxi companies need to continuously adapt and optimise theiroperations to meet changing demand patterns, ensure profitability and enhance customer satisfaction.
As an analyst at an upcoming taxi operation in NYC, you are tasked to use the 2023 taxi trip datato uncover insights that could help optimise taxi operations. The goal is to analyse patterns in thedata that can inform strategic decisions to improve service efficiency, maximise revenue and enhancepassenger experience.
**Dataset Overview**
Context:
The yellow taxi trip records include fields capturing details of the trips taken everyday by yellowtaxis in New York City. The data is stored in Parquet format (.parquet). The data set is from 2009 to 2024. However, for this assignment, we will only be using the data from 2023. The data for eachmonth is present in a different Parquet file. You will receive 12 files, one for each of the months in 2023. The data was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) bytechnology providers such as vendors and taxi-hailing apps.
Content:
•The dataset contains a set of 12Parquetfiles having records on attributes such as vendor ID,time and locations of pick-up and drop-off, payment type, fare amount and tips.
•Apart from the trip data, you will find a zipped foldertaxi_zones. This folder has a shapefilecontaining geometric data about the taxi zones. You will learn more about this while attemptingthe assignment.You can find the data dictionary here: [Data Dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf).
